## NASA's Webification
All of NASA's science data is available to the public.  Webification (w10n) is a NASA data access framework that enables developers to easily access data in web-friendly formats.

Webificaion simplifies use of the large and often complex data files published by NASA's Distributed Active Archive Centers, like [PO.DAAC](http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/).  The PO.DAAC w10n Service is open source software, that bridges the gap between Earth science data formats like NetCDF, HDF4 & HDF5 to JSON and XML.

## Re:Invent Challenge 
Full text [here](http://reinvent.awsevents.com/hackathon.html):
```
In this challenge you will use newly released planetary data APIs from NASA/JPL
to create an interactive web-based visualization that helps users better understand
the world around them. Data from over 2 dozen planetary satellites will be released
in restful, developer-friendly formats that expose new earth climate, weather and
topological data. Your goal is to help inspire the next generation of ideas, interest
and involvement in our country's space program.
